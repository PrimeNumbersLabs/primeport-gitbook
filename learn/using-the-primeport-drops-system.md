In this section, we'll explain everything you need to know regarding the PrimePort drops system.

### <mark style="color:purple;">**What’s the point of a drops system?**</mark>

We have a drops system so artists can release large collections of NFTs all in one go. The drops system gives the community the ability to mint NFTs before they go on general sale across the crypto space. It also allows the artist to release their collection in waves and to certain wallets on a whitelist if they wish.

### <mark style="color:purple;">**Before you start...**</mark>

Make sure you run through this process using the wallet you want to be attached to your NFT drop. The wallet you connect to PrimePort and start completing the below steps with is going to be the wallet that your NFT drop revolves around. We strongly advise that you use MetaMask as it’s the most compatible with our platform.

### <mark style="color:purple;">**How do I access the drops system?**</mark>

Firstly, you’ll need to go through the screening process. Connect your wallet to the PrimePort site and then click the **‘Create A Drop’** option in the bottom right corner. Fill out the form which will then be sent to the PrimePort team for review. Once they’ve approved your application you’ll then be granted access to the drops system to start preparing your NFT drop.

### <mark style="color:purple;">**How do I know if my application was approved?**</mark>

Once the PrimePort team have approved your application you’ll find a **‘My Drops’** option in your profile. This will only appear when you connect your wallet to PrimePort again after your application has been approved so to check if that’s happened disconnect your wallet and then reconnect and sign in again. If you can see the **‘My Drops’** option above the **‘Sign Out’** option then you’re good to go. Please bear in mind applications can take at least 48 hours to be approved and the team may request a meeting with you to validate the authenticity of your project.

### <mark style="color:purple;">**I’ve been approved. What next?**</mark>

Once you’ve been approved click **‘My Drops’** and here you can start preparing your NFT drop. Click on the drop and on the next screen you’ll be asked to enter a Name, Symbol and Description for your drop. At the bottom, you’ll see a toggle button. If you’re not very savvy when it comes to launching NFT collections then you want to turn this on and Prime Numbers will manage your images. However, if you are savvy and want to manage your own images via IPFS then leave this turned off and you’ll be responsible for managing your own data. Once you filled out the above correctly click the update button and move onto the next screen.

Next, you have a bunch of general settings to fill out relating to your NFT drop. Add your mint dates and quantity, edit the description, add an image for your collection etc. Once you’ve done that it’s very important you hit the update button at the bottom so it saves your data otherwise when you move to the next section you'll lose everything you filled out.

Once you’ve hit update you’ll see at the top you’ve got a bunch of headers so select Contract. Here is where you create your Smart Contract so press the **‘New Contract’** button and it will start deploying your contract. MetaMask will produce a transaction you need to confirm and then your smart contract will be created.

Next is the **‘Earnings’** section and here you want to enter the wallet address that the minting funds will be sent to and then hit Save. Your wallet will then appear with a transaction for updating the payout creator address which you’ll need to confirm.

Next is the **‘Gallery’** section and this is where you showcase the art for your NFT collection. You can upload a maximum of four files in a number of different formats. These will be the images displayed for your drop on the PrimePort marketplace.

Next is the **‘Team’** section and this is where you can tell the world about the awesome folks behind your project. Add their names, position, a description and an image for each team member.

The next section is **‘More Info’** and this is where you can showcase more detailed information about your NFT collection. You get to showcase one NFT and write about it in detail. You can then add a banner for your collection underneath.

In the **‘FAQ’** section you can add a bunch of questions you think your community might ask and provide them with the answers.

The next section is called **‘NFTs’** and this is where you upload your collection. You have two options here. You can either upload your NFTs one by one or you can use the CSV template to upload lots of NFTs in one go. It’s important that the number of NFTs you upload in this section matches the quantity you specified in the **‘General’** section at the beginning otherwise your scheduling won’t work later on. The **‘Select Status’** drop-down box gives you the ability to see the Frozen NFTs which are ones that have already been minted to the Smart Contract and the Draft NFTs which are ones that are yet to be minted.

### <mark style="color:purple;">**Now for the important bit...**</mark>

So you’ve filled out all the sections for your drop and you’ll see one of the sections is called **‘Important Settings’** which is the most important part of creating your drop. In this section, you’ll see two buttons. One to update the Metadata and one to update the Total NFT. It’s very important you press both buttons as this is what updates the smart contract.

So first off press the **‘Update Metadata’** button and your wallet will give you a transaction to confirm. Once complete you should see a success message that says **‘Updated base URL’**.

Next press the **‘Update Total NFT’** button and your wallet will give you another transaction to confirm. Once complete you should see a success message that says **‘Updated max supply’**.

Okay, good stuff you’ve now successfully created your drop and updated the Smart Contract correctly so let’s get your drop scheduled for release!

Lastly is the **‘Schedule’** section. If this section shows the below screen then you need to check the NFT quantity in the **‘General’** section matches the token count in the **‘NFTs’** section.

Once you’ve made the necessary corrections then the **‘Schedule’** section should show a **‘Create New’** button.

This is where you can set the schedules for your drop. You can set a whitelist schedule to give certain wallet addresses early access. You could set minting waves whereby it’s cheaper if they mint an NFT in the first few days etc. Once you’ve filled out the necessary information press the create button and you’ll now see a schedule in your list.

Congratulations! You have now scheduled the drop of your NFT collection and it should be visible in the **‘Upcoming’** section of the **‘Drops’** area on PrimePort. All that work has cost you next to nothing in fees because we’re built on the XDC Network where the gas fees are tiny!
